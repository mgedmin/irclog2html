2.16.0 (2017-12-20)
-------------------

- Support Python 3.6.

- Fix for duplicated lines with the same time where the resulting HTML ``id``
  anchors would evolve into long form like "t22:24:49-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10"
  instead of "t22:24:49-10" resulting in significant output file size growth
  in some cases.

- Add --output-dir (-o) parameter to logs2html so you can place the generated
  HTML files in a directory different from the input directory (`PR #20
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/irclog2html/issues/#20>`_).

  channels, detected by checking whether the directory modification date

- 2nd-level headings now have the same color as 1st-level headings.

- ``irclogserver`` no longer shows a 404 if you omit the trailing ``/``
  after a channel name in the URL.


2.15.1 (2016-09-25)
